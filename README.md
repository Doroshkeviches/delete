Hi there!
My name is Evgeniy Doroshkevich, I'm 21 years old
and I'm a frontend developer. I started my programmer path about 3 month ago
I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself :

I live in Minsk, Belarus.
Being teenager I have been studying in Lyceum BSU Chem/Math faculty.
Now I'm studying at Belarusian State Medical University, but I want to connect my life with coding.
Before programming i tryed my best at traiding, but understood that investing is more comfortable,
 because my competitive spirit have prevented me from thinking with cold head.
In coding this spirit gives me advantage and i try to make code better then others.



I'm interested in fishing and diving ,but in Belarus there are not enough rivers and lakes with clear water. In May and June before
 plants start to bloom  u can go diving and see a lot of parts of beautiful underwater world.
 

I also like to play video games such as Dota 2 and cs go.
My  achievement as being a top 5000 Eastern Europe player describes me as a purposeful person who can improve his own skills in any field
I'm taking care of.




My last project was BirdSong. I made a quiz where people need to answer what bird's voices are given to them.
In this project there is a lot of JS and it makes me better as a js developer ,
i have been practicing much skills such as work with functions and objects during this project.


My favourite project is gempuzzle.
I made a game сalled "Пятнашки".
In this game you need to аrrange puzzles in the correct order,
but don't take it that easy because the game can surprise you with it's difficulty.


I chose web development because it is the most interesting way in programming for me.
 I can display everything I represent in application.
 It motivates me and gives me a lot of experience to become a good developer.


I am skilled with JavaScript, NodeJs,but not only.
 I gladly work with other languages and technologies (HTML, CSS, SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, jQuery),
 and always like to try something new.
